# RAG Project

This repository was prepared for GitHub without changing any of your source code or function signatures. It adds the usual project files (README, requirements, .gitignore, and optional env example) so you can clone and run it easily.

## Project Structure
```
.htaccess
app0.py
requirements.txt
templates/response.html
```

## Getting Started
### 1) Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2) Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3) Use the code
Import the modules or run the scripts that you need. No changes were made to your original code.

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file (or set system env vars) with the following keys as needed:
- `CHROMADB_PATH`

## Notes
- Your original source files remain unmodified.
- If you already have your own dependency or run instructions, prefer those over the autogenerated ones here.

---
## Security note
- The code references `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. For safety, avoid hard-coding secrets. Use environment variables instead (see `.env.example`).
- **Rotate your existing key immediately** before publishing this repository publicly.
